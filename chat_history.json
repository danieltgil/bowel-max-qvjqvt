Implement the Screens:**\n\n*   **Onboarding:**\n    *   Create a series of screens with a short, friendly introduction (\"Let's learn about your gut health\").\n    *   Implement sliders for age, diet, and hydration.\n    *   Include a privacy reassurance statement (\"Photos analyzed securely\").\n*   **Home Screen:**\n    *   Add a large, centered button labeled \"Upload Stool Photo.\"\n    *   Display summary cards below the button, such as \"Last Analysis: Normal\" and \"Hydration: Low.\"\n    *   Implement a navigation bar with icons for Home, History, Insights, and Profile.\n*   **Upload/Analysis Screen:**\n    *   Allow users to upload or take a photo of their stool.\n    *   Show an animated loading indicator during the AI analysis.\n    *   Display an AI results card with:\n        *   Color and texture (with example color blocks).\n        *   Bristol stool scale type (with a small illustration).\n        *   A quick insight (e.g., \"Possible dehydration,\" \"Normal,\" \"High fiber\").\n        *   Friendly micro-copy like \"Healthy digestion incoming \ud83d\udca9.\"\n*   **History Screen:**\n    *   Create a list of past logs with icons or thumbnails.\n    *   Include trend graphs for hydration and stool type frequency.\n*   **Insights Screen:**\n    *   Display weekly digest cards (e.g., \"Your gut is trending healthier!\").\n    *   Use simple bar charts to visualize data.\n*   **Profile/Settings Screen:**\n    *   Allow users to edit their health information and goals (hydration, fiber).\n    *   Include a toggle for a premium plan.\n\n**3. Styling and UI Elements:**\n\n*   Use Cal AI-style simplicity with one clear action per screen.\n*   Incorporate soft animations for AI loading and success moments.\n*   Add light humor but maintain a clean aesthetic (avoid anything gross).\n*   Include subtle emojis and clear data visualization.\n\n**Plan of Action:**\n\n1.

This form will collect the necessary user details (name, age, etc.). Upon submission, this data will be stored in your Supabase database.\n*   **Extended Onboarding:** We'll modify the existing onboarding screen (`app/onboarding.tsx`) to include additional questions about gut health. These questions will cover topics like existing medical conditions, frequency of restroom use, and any other relevant information you deem necessary. The collected data will also be stored in the Supabase database along with the user's profile.\n*   **User Poop Table:** A new table will be created in Supabase to store individual poop entries for each user. This table will include columns for the user ID, timestamp of the entry, and any other relevant data points you want to track (e.g., stool color, texture, Bristol stool scale type).\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these steps or if you have any specific requirements for the implementation.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-26T02:56:31.252706"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you implement user registration, enhance the onboarding with gut health questions, and create a database structure for tracking poop entries.
